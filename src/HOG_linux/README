How to use:
1. To compile the code, you need download Boost library(http://www.boost.org/) with version 1.35 or higher.
2. To run the binary, you should make sure Boost so library is avaliable
3. The program are tested with Ubuntu 7.04, however, the API files are compitable with Windows also, and the binary utility hog.cpp depends on unistd.h.
